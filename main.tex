% this is where your thesis content goes
% - thesis is in multiple tex files separated for content
% - to make a new chapter, make file "NameOfChapter.tex" and write:
% % '''
% % \chapter{Name of Chapter}
% % [CONTENT GOES HERE]
% % '''
% - then write "\include{NameOfChapter}" below in the appropriate place
% - these chapter files cannot contain preamble stuff!

\include{content/chapter1}

\include{content/chapter2}

% ETC, ETC, ETC

\newpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% APPENDICES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
