% standard maths packages; include more below as necessary
\usepackage{amsthm,amssymb,mathtools}
% make QED symbol a filled box, instead of unfilled box
\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{$\blacksquare$}
% alternatively use the following:
% \renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{\vrule height 5pt width 4pt depth -1pt}

% I suggest using this package to make citations within the document easier
\usepackage{cleveref}
% now you can cite \Cref{label} and it will correctly pick a name
% E.g. it prints Section, Lemma, or Theorem, etc, depending on label reference

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% nice theorem formatting (change as needed)
